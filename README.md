# Unprotected OpenHW Group CORE-V CV32E40P IP

[CV32E40P](https://github.com/openhwgroup/cv32e40p/) is a small and efficient, 32-bit, in-order RISC-V core with a 4-stage pipeline that implements
the RV32IM\[F\]C instruction set architecture. It started its life as a fork of the OR10N CPU core that is based on the OpenRISC ISA. Then, under the name of RI5CY, it became a RISC-V core (2016), and it has been maintained
by the [PULP platform](https://www.pulp-platform.org/) team until February 2020,
when it has been contributed to [OpenHW Group](https://www.openhwgroup.org/).
